- For this application I've used most of the colours from hero image using developer tools. To make sure user not overwhelmed with lots of diffent colours or images I keep colours scheme soft and minimalistic.


- I have used #000000, #fff and #1B0735 as the primary colour for the content text, for border bottoms and buttons.

- I have used #4b3343 as the body background colour.

- I have used ##ff0000 for the buttons to display the wrong answers.

- I have used #047638 to display the correct answer.

- I have used #A1D3FF for icon.

- I have used #F8A5A0 for Quiz Qeustions and Sart Buttom section as backgroud.

## Typography

 I have used Google Fonts to import font for the site text content. I've choose Macondo 
[Macondo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Macondo?query=Macondo#type-tester) font style because it's reminded me Hindu or Sanskrit tradititional writing style.
